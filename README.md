# React (Component) libraries

Source code for my list of [React component libraries](https://react-libs.nilshartmann.net/), that was
previously a simple list in a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/nilshartmann/decb10d37a76ae3ab58f0c7755beb038).


## Contributing

If you like to add some libs, please feel free to add a PR (modify `data/components.txt`, see below) or open an issue.

### `components.txt`

The file `data/components.txt` contains the list of components. Each entry is separated by three dashes (`---`) and
contains four keys:

* `Name`: Readable, "official" name of the library. Used to sort the libraries
* `URL`: URL of the libraries homepage or GitHub repo
* `Category`: Used to group components in to several categories and provide filtering for them. You can just re-use on of the existing categories. Please copy+paste to avoid typos, as the categories are not checked against misspellings (and different spellings lead to different categories...)
* `Tags`: Not used yet. If you want, you can use the field to add comma separated tags that I will later use for more filtering.
* `Description`: Short description of the library. Can contain markdown code and can be split up into multiple lines.

Please also do not forget to add your name and link to `data/contributors.txt`!
